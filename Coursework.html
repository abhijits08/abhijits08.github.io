            <h1>Coursework</h1>

            <p>A list of selected modules I have completed at <a href="https://nus.edu.sg/" target="_blank">NUS</a> and <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Edinburgh</a>.</p>

            <h4>NUS (Ongoing PhD):</h4>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Advanced Topics on Vision and ML -</strong> <a href="https://www.eng.nus.edu.sg/ece/staff/li-haizhou/" target="_blank">Haizhou Li</a> & <a href="https://www.eng.nus.edu.sg/ece/staff/feng-jiashi/" target="_blank">Jiashi Feng</a></li>
                <li><strong>Trustworthy Machine Learning -</strong> <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~reza/" target="_blank">Reza Shokri</a></li>
                <li><strong>Adversarial Machine Learning -</strong> <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~reza/" target="_blank">Reza Shokri</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p>These were seminar-based modules. Each week we critically evaluated 2-4 research papers, and presented 1-2 research papers per semester. During some lectures, researchers at other universities were invited to share their work. My main takeaway from these modules was getting great exposure at performing critical analysis of research, and some ideas on how to conduct good research by following a rigorous research methodology.</p>

            <h4>University of Edinburgh (MSc in AI):</h4>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition (MLPR) -</strong> <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/imurray2/" target="_blank">Iain Murray</a></li>
                <li><strong>Machine Learning Practical (MLP) -</strong> <a href="https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/people/staff/Stephen_Renals.html" target="_blank">Steve Renals</a></li>
                <li><strong>Probabilistic Modelling and Reasoning (PMR) -</strong> <a href="https://michaelgutmann.github.io/" target="_blank">Michael Gutmann</a></li>
                <li><strong>Data Mining and Exploration (DME) -</strong> <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/aonken/" target="_blank">Arno Onken</a></li>
                <li><strong>Algorithmic Game Theory and its Applications (AGTA) -</strong> <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/kousha/" target="_blank">Kousha Etessami</a></li>
                <li><strong>Computational Cognitive Neuroscience (CCN) -</strong> <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/pseries/" target="_blank">Peggy Series</a></li>
                <li><strong>Neural Computation -</strong> <a href="https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/psychology/people/mark.vanrossum" target="_blank">Mark van Rossum</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p>These were coursework modules which had <a href="Projects.html">research projects</a> as assignments. <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/imurray2/" target="_blank">Iain Murray</a>'s MLPR course has been one of the most rewarding modules I've taken. MLPR and PMR were quite math-intensive, and gave me a solid background in theoretical and probabilistic machine learning. The MLP module allowed me to practically implement all the mathematical theory, and learn the importance of efficient coding in deep learning. The many <a href="Projects.html">research projects</a> in MLP also gave me an opportunity to dabble in diverse areas such as computer vision and natural language processing.<br>
            My natural curiosity also led me to take some of the challenging neuroscience and game-theory modules, and I learnt some really interesting things. If you are someone who loves learning eclectic subjects, <a href="index.html#contact">connect with me</a> and hopefully we can have insightful conversations!</p>
